# brag book

this is my brag book.

sometimes I loose sight of some small accomplishments I've had and some little wins, and do feel like I ain't doing enough. so this is basically where I can outline all my little wins, big or small, serious or fun and see if it helps me stay sane. 

visit [here](https://heyjay.netlify.app/) if you want to know what i've been up to... judgment-free. 😉

stay lit,
jay✌🏾
